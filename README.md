# Returna

A 3D top-down action RPG. Player uses simple attack options (one melee, one ranged) to explore a segmented open world. The objective is to find people to populate the starting town, opening up new features to make use of (Item shops, weapon upgrades, etc.)

The key feature is that as you play and defeat enemies to level up, your moveset changes depending on your playstyle eg. Players who favour ranged attacks and take little damage would evolve to an archer/sniper style character, while players who favour melee might evolve to a rogue or knight character, depending on how much damage they would take.

Features implemented:

- Basic movement system
- Basic melee attack system
- 1 enemy type
- Transition between locations in the world

Made with Unity

Status: Abandoned (due to scope size)
